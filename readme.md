Async waterfall is a control flow mechanism in Node.js that allows you to execute a series of asynchronous tasks in sequence, passing the results of each task as arguments to the next one. It ensures that each task starts only after the previous one has completed successfully. This pattern is particularly useful when you have a series of dependent asynchronous operations that need to be executed in a specific order.

How Async Waterfall Works
Async waterfall typically takes an array of functions (tasks) to be executed sequentially. Each function in the array receives a callback function as its last argument. This callback function is used to signal completion and optionally pass data to the next function in the sequence.

Hereâ€™s a basic outline of how async waterfall works:

Initial Setup: Define an array of functions (tasks) where each function performs an asynchronous operation and calls a callback function when done.

Execution: Start the waterfall with an initial input (optional) and a final callback function.

Control Flow: Each task executes in order. If any task encounters an error (by convention, the first argument passed to the callback is reserved for errors), subsequent tasks are skipped, and the final callback is called immediately with the error.

Completion: If all tasks complete successfully, the final callback is called with the final result.
